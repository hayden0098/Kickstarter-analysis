## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
From the Line charts of "Theater Outcomes by Launch Date", we can see that May and June are haveing the most successful outcomes in Theater category.
On the other hand, May to Aug almost have the same number of failed outcome, althought this are the months that number of outcomes were decreasing, number of 
successful are still higher than the number of failed and canceled. As conclusion the Theater category is the most successful one since haveing high successful 
outcomes and stable canceled outcomes in low number.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
From the Line chats of "Outcome Based on Goals Chart", we can see a patern that in the range less than $1000 to $24999 and range $40000 to $4999 are decreasing trend for percentage successful, increasing trend for percentage failed. In the range $25000 to $ $39999 and range $45000 to greater then 50000 are increasing trend for percentage successful, decreasing trend for percentage failed. Especially, the slpoe of line in range 30000 to 39999 and 40000 to 49999 are deeper then other. Also both successful and failed canceled remain unchange in range $35000 to $44999. percentage of failed and successful have the equal amount in range $15000 to$19999, $34999 to $39999. Therefore we can see that easy to success is the goals less then 1000, but wehn goal set to 25000 to 39999 will be increase the successful rate, especially the goal range 30000 to 39999.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
